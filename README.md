# Snowflake_Store_Project
This project showcases a Tableau dashboard that analyzes store performance across multiple dimensions from 2013 to 2014. It visualizes key metrics, including total sales, profitability, performance vs. target, and bonus allocations, using data from multiple SQL-based views from Snowflake.
